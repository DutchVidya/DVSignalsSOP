# Signals SOP & Documentation

Archival and backup of any and all Radio CSV, IMG files and SOPs for the handhelds and/or repeaters in use. Also includes any relevant or noteworthy radio programming or procedure used on an ad-hoc basis.
Radios are typically the common Baofeng UV-5Rs, and not PMR 446 devices, though SOP for usage would apply to them as well.

As Signals Operator, these devices will employ Frequencies under the UK Simple Light Licence, and scales up or down to accomodate devices as they are in use. Primarily they see use in Airsoft for inter-squad communication, and as such this documentation is written with that in mind - though some facets of it will fall outside of that scope. In particular, there are any CSV files for local repeaters when not in Operational Use, in conjunction with To Do items for handling or QOL.




## FAQ

#### This all looks like LARPing nonesense.

First of all that's not a question. Second, yea, kinda? The primary use of these devices is in Airsoft skirmishes and Milsim events, it's going to look vaguely like someone writing Tom Clancy fanfiction, but with sprinklings of interesting Signals stuff.

#### This all still seems like roleplaying to me.

That's still not a question.
