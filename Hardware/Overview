There are a lot of radios. For our purposes we do not use base stations or repeaters. When discussing Hardware these are Handheld devices.

## Baofeng UV-5R

The Primary Radio device we implement is the Baofeng UV-5R. It's not the newest model of Baofeng, but affordable, common and really popular. Baofengs are used by millions across the globe and the UV-5Rs were commercially purchased.

The licencing under which our Signals operate does cover them, though they have some limitations.

Given the limitations of Frequencies on the UV-5R, not all of the Simple Light UK Licencing Frequencies are going to work on them, but 10 of the 15 or so do, and this is more than enough.

They can implement CTCCS and DCS, support PTT microphones and headphones, and are easily carried in a radio specific pouch, magazine pouch, or even clipped to a belt or rig.

In use they have been solid workhorses in Urband and Woods environments, and have a good range, capable of maintaing inter-squad communication over distance.

## Additions

This is going to sound stupid but there's actually a few things worth discussing:

### Listening

Those in ear headphones and PTT mics the Baofengs come with are entirely passable but not great. Across the squad we see several use cases: Bowman style headsets and PTT Clips to third party in ear eaphone and PTT clips. Surprisingly, third party in ear devices have been really strong, with good mic sound and ease of use.

Whilst for Airsoft, connecting these to over ear headphones would probably be preferable, the in ears have been solid.

### Tinkering

Some smaller QOL has been adding O-Rings to the volume/power knobs, which turn easily in pouches or bags. This has been cheap, effective and life saving.

Further, alternative antenna! The Default Baofeng antennas are large, solid and annoying. Of recommendation have been shorter rubberised ones, or even the folding ones which can slide quite easily through Molle.

Preference has been for the shorter, rubberise Antenna, which work well with either full plate carriers, or chest rigs with limited space.
